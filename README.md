# ENGLISH TEACHER'S EDITOR

English Teacher's Editor is a Computer-Aided Language Learning Tool, a text processor aimed to help language teachers evaluate reading materials to select the most adequate ones for their students' proficiency level and assess students' written assignments. It implements a simple graphic user interface and NLP techniques.

## Features:

* Evaluate readability and the level of complexity:
*uses Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores adapted to second language learning;

* Check if the text is useful for a certain level

* See the top ten most frequent words in the document

* Count the words

* Check number of spelling mistakes

* Check the size of vocabulary used in the text

* Check the number of sentences

* Spellchecking

* Autocomplete

* See extended statistics on the text:
	* Vocabulary features: percentage of the words of major parts of speech;
	* Grammar features: percentage of the words with particular grammar properties:
		*  comparative and superlative adjectives;
     		*  modal verbs;

5. Make sure your downloaded the "data" folder and placed it in the project directory;
6. Run the class `application.Main.java`.

#### Usage
1. Open the file: you have options to open your files as a Text or as an Essay. The difference is in the desired interpretation of the readability scores  
2. Choose the statistics you would like to be computed and press the corresponding button:  
*Flesch* – calculate Flesch Reading Ease score;  
*Flesch-Kincaid*  -  Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score adapted to second language learning;  
*Show statistics* – to open the pop-up window displaying grammar and vocabulary features of the text: the number and the percentage of the following forms:   
*Vocabulary features*: number and percentage of words of major parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions, pronouns, numerals, determiners, wh-words; other – for the words that don’t fit into any of these categories);  
*Grammar features*: number and percentage of the words with particular grammar properties: comparative and superlative adjectives; modal verbs; number of imperative forms; number of existential pronouns; Present Simple Active; Present Perfect Active; Present Continuous Active; Past Simple Active; Past Perfect Active. Past Continuous Active; Present Perfect Continuous; Future Simple Active; Future Perfect Active; Future Continuous;   
        
Click *Show properties* – to see the top ten most frequent words in the document, number of words and sentences, number of spelling mistakes or unknown words, the size of vocabulary (number of unique words) used in the text.  

To see the percentage of words corresponding to a certain ESL exam, check the boxes with a corresponding level and click *Check the level* button.

To enable *Spellchecking* and *Autocomplete*, check the corresponding boxes. The options for autocomplete will appear near the cursor as soon as you start typing. To see spelling suggestions, click on the highlighted word.   
To replace the word with this option, select the option from the menu. You can save a highlighted word in the program’s dictionary by choosing *“Add to dictionary”* option.
